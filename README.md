# Godot Tile Cell Manager Plugin
By TheCowOhBoy, Built for Godot 3.2

## Overview
Tile Cell Manager is a plugin for Godot that adds a new tab on the bottom-panel when you are dealing with tiles. It facilitates level creation and makes it more directly.

## Features
* Tile thumbnail
* Cell id viewer
* Change name, Z-index or Modulation of the selected tile

## Usage

### Level Creation
Instead of entering into the TileSet inspector so you can edit a tile, you just edit right in the tab.

## Notes
I'll add more properties as I learn how to. 
Actually, I'm planning on doing a lot of things - I've already tested them and I know it will work, so my struggle is more about the plugin creation, for now.
Anyway, thanks a lot and, of course, any feedback is welcomed!
